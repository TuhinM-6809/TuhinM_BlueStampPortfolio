# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)

# Arduino Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTDgItoHk8w?si=aqH-RLGaW8Hp8VCv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The Arduino Starter Project provided a basic foundation for learning soldering and coding with Arduino. As part of the project, I built a Proto Shield for the Arduino UNO. This Proto Shield featured a reset button, resistors, LEDs, and rails for wire inputs. Using the Proto Shield, the Arduino UNO, and breadboard I built a circuit with a LED that was controlled by a button. I coded this button and LED using Arduino IDE, an application that uploaded code to the Arduino UNO. I used conditional statements to detect button presses and translate the result gained into a signal to turn the LED on or off.

# Code

```c++
//Defining the LED position on the Breadboard
#define LED_PIN 8
//Defining the Button position on the Breadboard
#define BUTTON_PIN 7

void setup() {
  //Defining the LED as the Output
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  //Defining the Button as the Input
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT);
}
void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN) == HIGH) { //If the button is pressed
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); //Turn on the LED
  }
  else { //If the button is not pressed
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); //Keep the LED off
  }
}
```
